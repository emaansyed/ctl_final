Partner Professor Dearborn Feedback:

December 11, 2019:
"Take the language from my release form and put it in a generic form without any reference to Suffolk defenders. Please do the same with the juvenile form. When you see easy to add to, I assume then it will be equally easy for any other lawyers we share the app with to add to themselves? Can you get releases for both MASAC locations, for the Lindemann Center, and can you google a few local recovery centers and add those. Thank you! Also is there a standard fax cover sheet built in?"

"It is user friendly and intuitive, and appears to be an excellent start for what I envisioned."

Final letter will be sent to Professor Colarusso
