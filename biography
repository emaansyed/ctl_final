##HIPAA Release of Information Form â€“ Emaan Syed
I created an app that will automate a HIPAA release form for the user to download through PDF and send via fax to a speficified hospital as to reduce the amount of time and manpower required in manually filling out and signing a HIPAA release form, and going back to a physical office to fax the form to the specified hospitals. User must input the required client information, and include the client's signature which can be done electronically on a phone or laptop, and send off the HIPAA release form to the medical institution of their choosing.
